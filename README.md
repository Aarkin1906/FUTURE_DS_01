Task 1: Superstore Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project
I’m excited to share my first project as an intern! I’ve been diving deep into e-commerce data to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps track sales performance, identify best-selling products, and uncover high-revenue categories.

📌 What I Worked On

Built a multi-page dashboard to track Sales ($1.6M), Profit ($175K), and Quantity sold (22K).

Compared 2019 vs 2020 data to see how the business grew year-over-year.

Added a 15-day sales forecast to predict demand for the start of 2021.

Mapped out sales by state to see where the most revenue is coming from (California is #1 at $0.34M).

📌 Key Insights Identified

Best Categories: Office Supplies is the top category ($0.64M), and Phones/Chairs are the best-selling individual items.

Growth Trends: There is a huge spike in sales every year from September to December. 2020 was much stronger than 2019.

Customer Segments: The "Consumer" group makes up almost half of all sales (48%).

Shipping & Payment: Most people (43%) still prefer Cash on Delivery (COD), and Standard Shipping is the most popular choice.

Regional Leader: The West region is the biggest market, bringing in 33% of total sales.

📌 Skills Gained
